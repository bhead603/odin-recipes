        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch square

        </p>
    </li>

        until light and fluffy in a bowl. Beat in espresso mixture, egg, and vanilla
        until well combined. Stir in flour mixture; mix until dough just begins to form. 
        Press dough firmly and evenly into the prepared pan using lightly floured hands.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Whisk 1 tbsp white sugar and remaining 1/2 tsp cinnaon togther in a small bowl;
        sprinkle sugar mixture evenly over the dough.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven just until the dough in the center of the pan feels
        barely set, 20 to 23 minutes.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><p>Allow cookies to cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Use the overhanging parchment
        to lift cookies out to wire rack; cool completely before cutting into bars.
